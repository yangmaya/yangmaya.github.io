          As I listened from a beach-chair in the shade
          To all the noises that my garden made, 
          It seemed to me only proper that words
          Should be withheld from vegetables and birds.
        </br>
        </br>
          A robin with no Christian name ran through
          The Robin-Anthem which was all it knew, 
          And rustling flowers for some third party waited
          To say which pairs, if any, should get mated.
        </br>
        </br>
          Not one of them was capable of lying, 
          There was not one which knew that it was dying
          Or could have with a rhythm or a rhyme
          Assumed responsibility for time.
        </br>
        </br>
          Let them leave language to their lonely betters
          Who count some days and long for certain letters; 
          We, too, make noises when we laugh or weep: 
          Words are for those with promises to keep.
